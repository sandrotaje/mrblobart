This is how he dives into the 'underground'\n                  culture and in its various arts and facets.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  The walls of his native city become a medium for his first artworks\n                  and technical experimentation in his early creative years.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  Mr. Blob chooses large formats that fully express his poetry of\n                  freedom and where no detail is left to chance.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In his early 20's, driven by the improvements in his abilities, he\n                  moves to Milan, where he finds a rich and diverse artistic scene.\n                  Here, he begins his collaborations with other artists from all parts of\n                  Italy that will lead him to participate in different events in Europe and\n                  overseas.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  In Milan, Blob establishes his unique style due to his subjects.\n                  Initially, these were nothing but a distortion of reality. His characters\n                  appeared with deformed faces and bodies, and all shared wide\n                  realistic eyes aimed at telling a personal story. In recent years, his\n                  interest and research in new characters result in a fusion between\n                  human and animal worlds, with the latter prevailing.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  His protagonists are mainly irrational living beings who act according to\n                  instinct, just like the artist with his illustrations. Each animal species,\n                  perceiving reality in a different way, develops features that are\n                  appropriate to the specific context, and this is what inspires Mr. Blob\n                  to highlight those 'supernatural senses', almost magical, that his\n                  creations present. Each character's features are enhanced through\n                  the use of colours, which he expertly mixes, creates and reshapes\n                  as in an actual magic ritual.\n                </p>\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"cta-buttons\">\n                <Link to=\"/contact\" className=\"cta-button\">Get in Touch</Link>\n                <Link to=\"/walls\" className=\"cta-button secondary\">View Gallery</Link>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["aboutImage","About","jsxs","jsx","Link"],"mappings":"8CAIA,MAAMA,EAAa,qBAEbC,EAAQ,IAEVC,EAAA,KAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,aACb,SAAA,CAACC,EAAA,IAAA,UAAA,CAAQ,UAAU,aACjB,SAACA,EAAAA,IAAA,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,YACb,SAACA,EAAA,IAAA,KAAA,CAAG,SAAiB,mBAAA,CAAA,CACvB,CAAA,EACF,EAEAA,EAAA,IAAC,UAAQ,CAAA,UAAU,wBACjB,SAAAA,EAAA,IAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,YACb,SAAAD,OAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,aACb,SAAA,CAACC,EAAAA,IAAA,MAAA,CAAI,UAAU,wBACb,SAAAA,EAAA,IAAC,MAAA,CACC,IAAKH,EACL,IAAI,iBACJ,UAAU,kBAAA,CAAA,EAEd,EACAE,EAAAA,KAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,qBACb,SAAA,CAAAC,EAAAA,IAAC,MAAG,SAAoB,sBAAA,CAAA,EACxBD,EAAAA,KAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,oBACb,SAAA,CAAAC,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAEH,sEAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAKH,2PAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAGH,gIAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAGH,gHAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAMH,kSAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SAOH,wYAAA,CAAA,EACAA,EAAAA,IAAC,KAAE,SASH,sgBAAA,CAAA,CAAA,EACF,EACAD,EAAAA,KAAC,MAAI,CAAA,UAAU,cACb,SAAA,CAAAC,MAACC,EAAK,CAAA,GAAG,WAAW,UAAU,aAAa,SAAY,eAAA,QACtDA,EAAK,CAAA,GAAG,SAAS,UAAU,uBAAuB,SAAY,cAAA,CAAA,CAAA,CACjE,CAAA,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CACF,CAAA,CAAA,EACF"}
